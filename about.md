# About Me

Hi! I’m Lily, QA Lead @ JetBrains, working on ReSharper and VSCode extensions. After 7+ years in QA (and a past life as a C# developer), I stepped into a leadership role to rethink how we test, how we collaborate, and how we deliver quality.

I started this blog to share my thoughts on testing, quality, processes, and everything in between. Some posts might be practical, some reflective, and some just me thinking out loud.

If you’re into testing, curious about how teams work behind the scenes, or just figuring things out like the rest of us — welcome!
